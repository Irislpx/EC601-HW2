#Task1:

For this task , I chose Bootstrap Web application. 

I created my own resume website using Bootstrap framework. What I have done is picking up a easy-to-start template, modifing it's style and color.Besides, I made screen scrollful and be able to be tracked by nevigate bar. In the end, released website through Github pages.
